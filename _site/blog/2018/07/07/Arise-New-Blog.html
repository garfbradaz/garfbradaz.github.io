<h2 id="its-alive">It’s alive!</h2>

<p>I have wanted to move <a href="https://mywebanecdotes.com/">my current</a> off Wordpress for sometime, but time has always been a factor. As a developer I find myself living within <em>Visual Studio Code</em>, so I decided to set up a blog which can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use my Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Use my git skills</li>
</ul>

<p>I knew github has <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, and it used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. So I have started a Github page. So this is day one. I chose a minimal theme  for the site, and each change to the site I will document as a blog post. Think of them as Release Notes!</p>

<p>As I move on I change the style and layout etc, ut for now (and posterity) here is the Home Page from day 1:</p>
