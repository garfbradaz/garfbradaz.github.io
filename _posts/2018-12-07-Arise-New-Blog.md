## It's alive!

I have wanted to move [my current](https://mywebanecdotes.com/) off Wordpress for sometime, <!--more-->, but time has always been a factor. As a developer I find myself living within *Visual Studio Code*, so I decided to set up a blog which can:

- Use my Visual Studio Code
- Use my git skills

I knew github has [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and it used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). So I have started a Github page. So this is day one. I chose a minimal theme  for the site, and each change to the site I will document as a blog post. Think of them as Release Notes!

As I move on I change the style and layout etc, but for now (and posterity) here is the Home Page from day 1:
